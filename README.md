## Quick start

Tomo is distrubuted as a ruby gem and has loads of built-in documentation. An easy way to kick the tires is to `gem install` tomo and view the `--help`.

```
$ gem install tomo
Fetching tomo-0.1.0.gem
Successfully installed tomo-0.1.0
1 gem installed
$ tomo --help

  Usage: tomo COMMAND [options]

  Tomo is an extensible tool for deploying projects to remote hosts via SSH.
  Please specify a COMMAND, which can be:

    deploy     Deploy the current project to remote host(s)
    init       Start a new tomo project with a sample config
    run        Run a specific remote task from the current project
    setup      Prepare the current project for its first deploy
    tasks      List all tasks that can be used with the run command
    version    Display tomo‚Äôs version

  ...
```

Let's init a project to see how that looks.

```
$ cd my-rails-app
$ tomo init
‚úî Created .tomo/config.rb
```

The `.tomo/config.rb` file defines all the settings and tasks needed to setup and deploy a typical Rails project. An abbreviated version looks like this:

```ruby
# .tomo/config.rb

plugin "git"
plugin "bundler"
plugin "rails"
# ...

host "user@hostname.or.ip.address"

set application: "my-rails-app"
set deploy_to: "/var/www/%<application>"
set git_url: "git@github.com:my-username/my-rails-app.git"
set git_branch: "master"
# ...

setup do
  run "git:clone"
  run "git:create_release"
  run "bundler:install"
  run "rails:db_schema_load"
  # ...
end

deploy do
  run "git:create_release"
  run "core:symlink_shared_directories"
  run "core:write_release_json"
  run "bundler:install"
  run "rails:assets_precompile"
  run "rails:db_migrate"
  run "core:symlink_current"
  # ...
end
```

Eventually you'd want to edit the config file to specify the appropriate user and host, perhaps define some custom tasks, and tweak the settings to make them suitable for your Rails app. You can also take advantage of more advanced features like multiple hosts and environment-based config. But in the meantime, let's take a look at how the `deploy` command works:

```
$ tomo deploy --help

  Usage: tomo deploy [--dry-run] [options]

  Sequentially run the "deploy" list of tasks specified in .tomo/config.rb to
  deploy the project to a remote host. Use the --dry-run option to quickly
  simulate the entire deploy without actually connecting to the host.

  ...
```

We can simulate an entire deploy with the `--dry-run` option. Let's try it:

```
$ tomo deploy --dry-run
tomo deploy v0.1.0

* ‚Ä¢ core:log_revision
* Writing 43 bytes to /var/www/my-rails-app/revisions.log
* Simulated deploy of tomo to user@hostname.or.ip.address (dry run)
```

Tomo can also run individual remote tasks, which comes in very handy. Use the `tasks` command to see the list of tasks tomo knows about. By the way, it is very easy to write your own tasks to add to this list.

```
$ tomo tasks
bundler:clean
bundler:install
bundler:upgrade_bundler
core:clean_releases
core:create_shared_directories
core:log_revision
core:setup_directories
...
```

One of the built-in Rails tasks is `rails:console`, which brings up a fully-interactive Rails console over SSH. We can simulate this with `--dry-run` as well.

```
$ tomo run rails:console --dry-run
tomo run v0.1.0
* ‚Üí Connecting to user@hostname.or.ip.address
* ‚Ä¢ rails:console
* cd /var/www/my-rails-app/current && bundle exec rails console
```

As you can see, it is pretty easy to get started with tomo and try things out. Tomo is even more friendly and powerful with the help of bash completions. If you use bash, run `tomo completion-script` for instructions on setting them up.

## Support

Thanks for your interest in Tomo! I use Tomo myself to deploy my own Rails projects and intend to keep this repository working and up to date for the foreseeable future. However Tomo is only a hobby, and as the sole maintainer, my ability to provide support and review pull request is limited and a bit sporadic. My priorities right now are:

1. Improve test coverage
2. Keep the project free of any serious bugs
3. Stay up to date with the latest versions of Ruby and gem dependencies

If you'd like to help by submitting a pull request, that would be much appreciated! Check out the contribution guide to get started.

Otherwise if you want to report a bug, or have ideas, feedback or questions about Tomo, [let me know via GitHub issues](https://github.com/mattbrictson/tomo/issues/new) and I will do my best to provide a helpful answer. Happy hacking! ‚ÄîMatt
