☁️ Multi-environment and role-based multi-host support<br/>
💎 Everything you need to deploy a basic Rails app out of the box<br/>
🔌 Easily extensible for polyglot projects (not just Rails!)<br/>
💡 Concise, helpful error messages<br/>
📚 Quality documentation<br/>
🔬 Minimal dependencies<br/>

This project wouldn't be possible without the generosity of the open source Ruby community. Please support open source projects and your fellow developers by helping answer questions, contributing pull requests to improve code and documentation, or just [drop a note](https://saythanks.io/to/mattbrictson) to say thanks! ❤️

## Support

Thanks for your interest in Tomo! I use Tomo myself to deploy my own Rails projects and intend to keep this repository working and up to date for the foreseeable future. However Tomo is only a hobby, and as the sole maintainer, my ability to provide support and review pull request is limited and a bit sporadic. My priorities right now are:

1. Improve test coverage
2. Keep the project free of any serious bugs
3. Stay up to date with the latest versions of Ruby and gem dependencies

If you'd like to help by submitting a pull request, that would be much appreciated! Check out the contribution guide to get started.

Otherwise if you want to report a bug, or have ideas, feedback or questions about Tomo, let me know and I will do my best to provide a helpful answer. Happy hacking! —Matt
